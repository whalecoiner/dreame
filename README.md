# Dreame L10 Pro

I recently rooted my Dreame L10 Pro (model `dreame.vacuum.p2029`). There was a bunch of audio files in there that I wanted to save and document.

I don't own the copyright on these audio files - they are kept here for purely academic purposes.

## Sound files and text

I spent 20 minutes of my life transcribing these sound files, so be grateful you little rascals.

## Online sound files

As well as living on the Dreame L10 Pro the sound files are also found at https://awsde0.fds.api.xiaomi.com/dreame-product/dreame.vacuum.p2029/voices/soundpackage.json

The English tar file content matchs up with the filename table above but with some extra sound files, which I assume are for a different model or a later official firmware release.

Don't Vacuumn Me also has some matching sound files at https://builder.dontvacuum.me/pkg/voice/dreame/mc1808/EN.tar.gz. This must be for an older model as the audio is performed by a different actress and is of frankly terrible quality.

## Generate your own sound files

For now you can do this manually by copying custom sound files (named according to the above table) to `/etc/audio/<your language>/` in Ogg Vorbis format on your Dreame L10 Pro.

As soon as I have time I'll make a script that loops over the CSV and creates a sound pack.
